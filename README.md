Copying folders to Google Drive should be easy, in fact there is no such feature available. However, when you are using Google Drive for desktop, there are several solutions you can use to copy folders and all their contents.

Creating a new document is one of the most basic commands you need in Google Docs. You can create a new blank document, or you can create a new document based on a template.

Open a folder in Google Drive.
Click the New button.
Select Google Docs.

## How To Copy A Folder In Google Drive?

Google Drive might be one of the best cloud storage services, but it still lacks some notable options. Although you can copy files in Google Drive, there is no option in context menus to copy or duplicate folders. So how are you supposed to copy Google Drive folders? Here are the options.

1. Copy Multiple Files to a New Google Drive Folder
  * Select all the files in the folder by pressing the “Ctrl + A” hotkey, then right-click on one and choose “Make a copy.”
  * Now, new copies of the files appear in the same folder with “Copy of…” in the file titles. Next, right-click any one of the original files and select “Move to” on the context menu.
  * Select an existing folder or click the gray “New Folder” icon to add a new one.
  * If you chose to add a new folder, enter a name in the box, then click on the “blue checkmark.”
  * Click on “Move Here” to finish the folder selection.
  * A notification appears in the bottom-right section, showing that the files got moved successfully. You can click on “UNDO” if you made a mistake, but act fast before the notification disappears.
  * To confirm successful file transfer to the new folder, navigate to it and verify that the files appear. The original files are now copied to a new folder, which replaces the nonexistent Google Drive folder copying option.

2. Copy Folders with the Backup and Sync App
  * Install Drive for Desktop software.
  * Open the software and select the Google account to use.
  * Choose some folders to back up to Google Drive, and select the “Sync My Drive to this Computer” option.
  * Open File Explorer after Windows has synced with My Drive. Click the “Google Drive” folder to open it.
  * Next, “right-click” a folder to copy. Select the “Copy” option in the context menu.
  * Press the “Copy to” button, then select to save the copied folder in “Google Drive.”
  * Now, you can open that copied folder from the cloud storage’s browser tab to confirm the copied folder appears.

## How to create shortcuts to avoid duplicates?

Google Drive has also introduced a keyboard shortcut that lets you create a shortcut to a file. If you want to keep the same document in different folders, you can create shortcuts in all these folders to avoid creating multiple copies of the same file and losing track of edits.

To create a shortcut to another file within Google Drive, select the file and copy it (Ctrl+C or Command+C) and then use the Ctrl+Shift+C keyboard shortcut on Windows, or Command+Shift+C on Mac.
